Prediction of heart failure - Knowing the factors affecting heart failure
                               Introduction
1.1 Problem statement
                               
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally,
taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of
all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks
and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people
under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs,
and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict a possible
heart disease.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk
(due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension,
diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or already established disease) need early
detection and management, wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.






How to analyze and preprocess a dataset of heart diseasecases using Python and various libraries such as pandas,seaborn, plotly, and sklearn.
The notebook first imports the necessary libraries and loadsthe data from a CSV file into a pandas dataframe. It thenexplores the data by checking its shape, columns, types,info, and descriptive statistics
The notebook then visualizes the data using various plotssuch as histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to understandthe distribution, outliers, and correlation of the features. Italso groups the data by different categories such as sex,chest pain type, and heart disease
The notebook then preprocesses the data by handling nullvalues, duplicated values, and outliers. It also transformsthe data by scaling the numerical features and encoding
the categorical features using one-hot encoding
The notebook ends with a concatenation of the original andtransformed data into a final dataframe that is ready formodeling and prediction
Improving health outcomes: The analysis of heart diseasedata can help to identify risk factors, predict outcomes, anddevelop interventions that can improve health outcomes forpatients with heart disease
