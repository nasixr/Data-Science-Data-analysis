Prediction of heart failure - Knowing the factors affecting heart failure
                               Introduction
1.1 Problem statement
                               
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally,
taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of
all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks
and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people
under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs,
and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict a possible
heart disease.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk
(due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension,
diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or already established disease) need early
detection and management, wherein a machine learning model can be of
great help.
